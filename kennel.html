           <p>Also known as canine tracheobronchitis, kennel cough is a highly contagious and infectious disease. It is transmitted through the air, usually in areas where there is a dense population of dogs such as a kennel or a show. The treatment for kennel cough is usually administered as a nasal spray, although there is an injection available for dogs who find it extremely uncomfortable.</p>

            <li>
                    Dogs "catch" kennel cough when they inhale bacteria or virus particles into their respiratory tract. This tract is normally lined with a coating of mucus that traps infectious particles, but there are a number of factors that can weaken this protection and make dogs prone to kennel cough infection, which results in inflammation of the larynx (voice box) and trachea (windpipe).

                 <li> A dry hacking or honking cough, retching and nasal discharge. Most dogs that contract kennel cough will show a lack of appetite, but some may not. The illness may progress into secondary pneumonia, and include a high temperature, lethargy, and in extreme cases death.
                        If your dog shows these symptoms contact your vet immediately. Do not take your dog into the vets until you have notified the receptionist, otherwise you may infect other dogs.
