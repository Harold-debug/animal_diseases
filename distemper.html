                Canine distemper is a very serious viral disease. It can be transmitted through the air from dog to dog. It is highly contagious and there is no known cure, which is why it is very important that you get your dog vaccinated against it.

                        If you suspect that your dog has contracted canine distemper, contact your vet immediately. Do not take your dog into the vets until you have notified the receptionist, otherwise you may infect other dogs.

         <p>There is unfortunately no cure for distemper and the biggest goal is to prevent it to begin with. Your veterinarian will encourage you to get your puppy vaccinated within the first 4-6 weeks of their life and continue vaccinating up until he is 14-16 weeks old. After your dog has his initial vaccination, boosters can be done every 3 years. If your puppy survives distemper he will be immune for at least 20 months and possibly for life. The treatment options that are available include keeping your dog healthy once he has been exposed. This includes ensuring they are remaining hydrated and avoiding further infections once they are already vulnerable. Antibiotics can be used to help your dog get better.
